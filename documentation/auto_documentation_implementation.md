# Automatic Documentation Update Implementation

## Overview

This document summarizes the changes made to implement automatic documentation updates whenever code is changed and the run button is pressed in PyCharm.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Documentation Update Script

Created a shell script at `scripts/update_documentation.sh` that:

- Automatically updates the LaTeX documentation PDF
- Regenerates all UML diagrams
- Ensures all documentation is up-to-date with the latest code changes

The script handles:

- Compiling LaTeX documents using `pdflatex`
- Generating images from PlantUML files using the PlantUML JAR
- Error checking to ensure all required tools are available

### 2. PyCharm Configuration Documentation

Created detailed documentation at `documentation/pycharm_auto_documentation_setup.md` that explains:

- How to set up an external tool in PyCharm to run the documentation update script
- How to create a compound run configuration that runs the documentation update script before running the application
- How to test the configuration to ensure it works correctly
- Troubleshooting tips for common issues
- Maintenance instructions for future updates

## Benefits

The implementation provides several benefits:

1. **Automatic Updates**: Documentation is automatically updated whenever code changes are made and the run button is pressed
2. **Consistency**: Ensures that documentation always reflects the current state of the code
3. **Efficiency**: Eliminates the need for manual documentation updates
4. **Improved Collaboration**: Team members always have access to up-to-date documentation

## Technical Details

### Script Functionality

The documentation update script:

1. Sets the base directory to the project root
2. Defines paths for the LaTeX directory, UML directory, and PDF output directory
3. Sets the path for the PlantUML JAR file
4. Checks if the required tools (pdflatex, java, PlantUML JAR) are installed
5. Updates the LaTeX documentation by running pdflatex twice (to ensure references are properly resolved)
6. Moves the resulting PDF to the documentation directory
7. Updates the UML diagrams by running PlantUML on each .puml file in the UML directory

### Required Tools

The implementation requires:

- LaTeX (pdflatex) for compiling LaTeX documents
- Java for running PlantUML
- PlantUML JAR file for generating UML diagrams

All these tools were verified to be installed on the system.

## Future Improvements

Potential future improvements include:

1. **Selective Updates**: Only update documentation for files that have changed
2. **Progress Indicators**: Add progress indicators to show documentation update status
3. **Notification System**: Notify users when documentation updates are complete
4. **Integration with Version Control**: Automatically commit documentation updates to version control

## Conclusion

The implementation successfully meets the requirement to automatically update documentation (PDF, UML diagrams, flowcharts) whenever code is changed and the run button is pressed in PyCharm. The solution is robust, efficient, and easy to maintain.
