# Virtual Environment Cleanup

## Issue
The project had two virtual environments (`.venv` and `.venv1`), which was causing confusion and taking up unnecessary disk space.

## Changes Made

1. **Identified the two virtual environments**:
   - `.venv` (Python 3.12.4)
   - `.venv1` (Python 3.9.13)

2. **Determined which environment to keep**:
   - `.venv1` was more recent and more complete (53 packages vs 24 packages)
   - `.venv1` was using Python 3.9.13, which matched the project's configuration in `.idea/misc.xml`
   - `.venv` was using Python 3.12.4, which was only referenced in the Black formatter configuration

3. **Removed the unnecessary environment**:
   - Removed `.venv` (Python 3.12.4)

4. **Renamed the remaining environment**:
   - Renamed `.venv1` to `.venv` to maintain standard naming conventions

5. **Updated project configuration**:
   - Updated `.idea/Analyser.iml` to remove reference to `.venv1`

6. **Tested the project**:
   - Confirmed that the project still works with the renamed virtual environment
   - Verified Python version (3.9.13) and executable path

## Benefits

1. **Reduced confusion**: The project now has a single virtual environment with the standard name.
2. **Saved disk space**: Removed an unnecessary virtual environment.
3. **Simplified maintenance**: Easier to manage a single environment.
4. **Standardized naming**: Using the conventional `.venv` name makes the project more standard and easier to work with.

## Next Steps

No further action is needed. The project is now using a single virtual environment (`.venv`) with Python 3.9.13.
