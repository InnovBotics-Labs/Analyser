## System Architecture
The Budget Analyser application follows a layered architecture pattern, specifically implementing the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern with additional framework utilities. This architecture separates the application into distinct components, each with specific responsibilities, making the system more maintainable, extensible, and testable.

### Architectural Layers

#### View Layer
The View layer is responsible for the user interface components and user interaction. It includes:
- **Ui_Widget**: The login screen UI
- **Ui_MainWindow**: The main dashboard UI
- **InputDisplayApp** and **ExpenseReport**: Test UI components

#### Model Layer
The Model layer is responsible for data management and business logic. It includes:
- **Statements**: Collects and formats financial transaction data
- **OriginalStatement**: Provides raw transaction data
- **StatementFormatter**: Formats raw statements into a consistent format

#### Controller Layer
The Controller layer acts as an intermediary between the View and Model layers, processing user input and updating the model and view accordingly. It includes:
- **Report**: Generates various financial reports from transaction data
- **Processor**: Processes raw transactions by adding categorization

#### Framework Layer
The Framework layer provides utility classes and services used by the other layers. It includes:
- **Logger**: Provides centralized logging (implemented as a Singleton)
- **PandasToolkit**: Utility methods for pandas DataFrame operations
- **JsonHandler**: Handles JSON file loading and parsing

## Key Features

The application generates various financial reports, including:
- Earnings reports showing sources of income
- Expense reports showing where money is being spent
